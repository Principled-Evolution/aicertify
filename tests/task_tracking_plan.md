# Task Tracking Plan for EU AI Act Integration

## Overview
This document tracks all tasks and milestones required for integrating EU AI Act support into the AICertify framework. It continuously refers back to the [Integration Plan](AICertify/integration_plan_rego_policy_integration.md) to ensure that all work remains aligned with the project goals and milestones.

## Milestones and Deliverables

### 1. Policy Integration Module
- **Task 1.1:** Identify and list all rego policy files under the `eu_ai_act` folder (and its subfolders).
- **Task 1.2:** Format the rego policies using `opa fmt --write eu_ai_act/**/*.rego` and validate them with `opa check eu_ai_act/**/*.rego`.
- **Task 1.3:** Add new rego policies to support the EU AI Act. For the policies that are supported by our evaluators, implement realistic and detailed compliance logic based on evaluator measurements. For any policies without associated evaluators, add placeholders analogous to `diagnostic_safety.rego` for healthcare.

> **DONE Criteria:** All new EU AI Act policies are in place (with placeholders as needed) and have passed validation with opa check.

### 2. API and Evaluator Integration
- **Task 2.1:** ✅ Update evaluation functions in `api.py` (e.g., `evaluate_contract_with_phase1_evaluators` and `evaluate_contract_comprehensive`) to accept a `policyCategory` and `policy_folder` (as relevant) parameter that supports the new option `'eu_ai_act'`.
- **Task 2.2:** ✅ Merge evaluator outputs with the OPA policy evaluation results for EU AI Act based on the integration plan guidelines.

> **DONE Criteria:** API functions are updated and properly merge evaluator measurements with OPA policy results for EU AI Act policies.

### 3. Report Generation Enhancements
- **Task 3.1:** Extend report generation mechanisms in the ComplianceEvaluator and API functions to support PDF reports using ReportLab.

> **DONE Criteria:** PDF reports are generated that match the style and quality of the existing sample (e.g., Medical Diagnosis Multi-Specialist report) reflecting EU AI Act evaluations.

### 4. End-to-End Evaluation Script
- **Task 4.1:** ✅ Create a new evaluation script (e.g., `debug_policy_evaluation_eu_ai_act.py`) by copying and modifying `debug_policy_evaluation.py` to focus on EU AI Act policies.

> **DONE Criteria:** The new script accurately loads EU AI Act policies, merges evaluator and OPA outputs, and produces consolidated compliance reports.

### 5. Developer Interface Improvements
- **Task 5.1:** ✅ Design and implement a model-card interface in `api.py` to facilitate the input of model metadata and evaluation parameters in a clear, developer-friendly manner.

> **DONE Criteria:** The model-card interface is simple, well-documented, and consistent with our design principles as detailed in the Developer Guide, ensuring high usability.

## Additional Considerations
- **Alignment Check:** After each task/milestone, refer back to the [Integration Plan](AICertify/integration_plan_rego_policy_integration.md) to ensure complete alignment with EU AI Act requirements.
- **Documentation & Developer Experience:** Ensure all design changes are well documented. Prioritize clarity, simplicity, and consistency to promote ease-of-use and adoption.

## Status Tracking
- **Policy Integration Module:** Completed
- **API and Evaluator Integration:** Completed
- **Report Generation Enhancements:** In Progress / Completed
- **End-to-End Evaluation Script:** Completed
- **Developer Interface Improvements:** Completed

## Next Steps
- Regularly review and update this document as work progresses.
- Maintain synchronous updates with the integration plan to ensure that all milestones are met and that our approach remains aligned with project goals.
