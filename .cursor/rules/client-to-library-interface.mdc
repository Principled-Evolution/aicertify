# Your rule content

- You can @ files here

- You can use markdown but dont have to
Document Clear Boundaries:
LIBRARY: aicertify/ package → implements all logic
CLIENT: examples/ folder → only calls the API
Create a Consistent API Pattern:
The API should always handle errors internally
Functions should return standardized, well-documented data structures
Simplify Example Apps:
Example apps should demonstrate the API's simplicity
They should not contain complex error handling or alternative evaluation paths
