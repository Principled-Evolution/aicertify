- ✅ Created `__init__.py` for prohibited practices evaluators
- ✅ Implemented `VulnerabilityExploitationEvaluator` class for EU AI Act Article 5(1)(b)
- ✅ Implemented `SocialScoringEvaluator` class for EU AI Act Article 5(1)(c)
- ✅ Implemented `EmotionRecognitionEvaluator` class for EU AI Act Article 5(1)(f)

### 3. DeepEval Extension - Hallucination and Accuracy Assessment

- ✅ Enhanced hallucination metrics with DeepEval's `HallucinationMetric`
- ✅ Created `AccuracyEvaluator` class with `HallucinationMetric` and `FactualConsistencyMetric`

### 4. LangFair Extension - Biometric Categorization Detection

- ✅ Analyzed LangFair stereotype metrics and documented extension approach
- ✅ Implemented `BiometricCategorizationEvaluator` class with custom metrics

### 5. HuggingFace Model Cards Integration

- ✅ Created directory structure for documentation evaluators
- ✅ Created `__init__.py` for documentation evaluators
- ✅ Enhanced `ModelCardEvaluator` with improved documentation completeness scoring

### 6. Integration with Existing Framework

- ✅ Updated main evaluators `__init__.py` to register new evaluators
- ✅ Updated `ComplianceEvaluator` to include new evaluators
- ✅ Integrated with `debug_policy_evaluation.py` for testing
- ✅ Integrated with `api.py` for API access

## Remaining Tasks

### 7. Testing and Validation

- ❌ Create unit tests for all new evaluators
- ❌ Create integration tests
- ❌ Create end-to-end tests
- ❌ Validate against real-world examples

### 8. Documentation

- ❌ Update developer documentation
- ❌ Create user documentation
- ❌ Update API documentation

## Implementation Details

### New Evaluators

1. **VulnerabilityExploitationEvaluator**
   - Detects exploitation of vulnerabilities based on age, disability, or socioeconomic status
   - Uses DeepEval's G-Eval with custom criteria
   - Provides detailed evaluation results and recommendations

2. **SocialScoringEvaluator**
   - Detects social scoring systems that lead to detrimental treatment
   - Uses DeepEval's G-Eval with custom criteria
   - Provides detailed evaluation results and recommendations

3. **EmotionRecognitionEvaluator**
   - Detects emotion recognition in workplace and educational contexts
   - Uses DeepEval's G-Eval with custom criteria
   - Provides detailed evaluation results and recommendations

4. **AccuracyEvaluator**
   - Assesses hallucination and factual accuracy
   - Uses DeepEval's HallucinationMetric and FactualConsistencyMetric
   - Provides detailed evaluation results and recommendations

5. **BiometricCategorizationEvaluator**
   - Detects biometric categorization based on gender, ethnicity, age, and disability
   - Extends LangFair's StereotypeMetrics with custom metrics
   - Provides detailed evaluation results and recommendations

### Integration Points

1. **ComplianceEvaluator**
   - Updated to include all new evaluators
   - Added configuration options for new evaluators
   - Added new evaluators to all_evaluators dictionary

2. **debug_policy_evaluation.py**
   - Updated to use new evaluators
   - Added configuration options for all new evaluators
   - Added call to evaluate_contract_with_phase1_evaluators before OPA policy evaluation

3. **api.py**
   - Enhanced evaluate_contract_comprehensive function to include default configuration for all new evaluators
   - Improved integration between Phase 1 evaluators and OPA policy evaluation
   - Added better report generation with combined results

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Create unit tests for all new evaluators
   - Create integration tests for all integration points
   - Create end-to-end tests for complete evaluation flow
   - Validate against real-world examples

2. **Documentation**
   - Update developer documentation to include new evaluators
   - Create user documentation with usage examples
   - Update API documentation with new evaluators

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the updated framework to production
   - Monitor for any issues or regressions
   - Gather feedback from users

## Conclusion

The implementation of Phase 1 recommendations has been largely successful, with all core functionality implemented and integrated with the existing framework. The remaining tasks focus on testing, validation, and documentation, which are essential for ensuring the quality and usability of the framework.

The new evaluators provide comprehensive coverage of the EU AI Act requirements, particularly in the areas of prohibited practices, accuracy assessment, and biometric categorization. The integration with the existing framework ensures that these evaluators can be easily used through the API and debug tools.
