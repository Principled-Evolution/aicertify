# LangFair vs. EU AI Act OPA Compliance

| **EU AI Act OPA Requirement**             | **Implemented in LangFair?** | **Feasibility of Extension** | **Alternative Implementation** |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Prohibited AI Practices**                | **Partially** (focuses on bias/fairness but not explicit bans) | **Feasible** (Extend LangFair to enforce explicit prohibitions) | Implement OPA policies separately for enforcement |
| **High-Risk AI Classification**            | **No** (LangFair does not classify AI systems into risk levels) | **Feasible** (Introduce AI risk categorization module) | Use external classifiers or regulatory audit pipelines |
| **Transparency Obligations**               | **Yes** (LangFair enforces disclosure and interpretability) | **Already covered** | No alternative needed |
| **Toxicity and Bias Detection**            | **Yes** (Through `ToxicityMetrics` and `StereotypeMetrics`) | **Already covered** | No alternative needed |
| **Counterfactual Fairness Assessment**     | **Yes** (Through `CounterfactualMetrics`) | **Already covered** | No alternative needed |
| **Allocational Harm Evaluation**           | **Yes** (Through `AllocationMetrics`) | **Already covered** | No alternative needed |
| **Logging and Traceability**               | **No** (LangFair lacks systematic logging enforcement) | **Feasible** (Add logging/tracing requirements to LangFair modules) | Implement external logging via OPA policies |
| **Governance and Compliance**              | **No** (LangFair does not enforce regulatory governance) | **Limited** (LangFair could provide audit reports but lacks governance enforcement) | Use OPA for compliance verification |
| **User and Provider Obligations**          | **No** (LangFair does not regulate AI providers) | **Not Feasible** (LangFair is a fairness assessment tool, not a governance tool) | Implement governance checks in an OPA policy framework |
| **Cybersecurity Safeguards**               | **No** (LangFair does not handle cybersecurity measures) | **Not Feasible** (Security monitoring is outside LangFair's scope) | Use external AI security tools with OPA integration |
| **Regulatory Sandbox Compliance**          | **No** (LangFair does not support AI regulatory sandboxes) | **Feasible** (LangFair could integrate with sandbox tools for controlled testing) | Use separate sandbox governance frameworks |
| **AI Database Registration**               | **No** (LangFair does not register AI models) | **Not Feasible** (LangFair does not act as an AI registry) | Implement EU database registration via external compliance frameworks |

# Summary
- **LangFair already covers** key fairness assessment dimensions such as **toxicity, stereotypes, counterfactual fairness, and allocational harms**.
- **Feasible extensions** include adding **risk classification, logging, and sandbox compliance** capabilities.
- **OPA or external compliance frameworks** are necessary for enforcing **prohibitions, governance, cybersecurity, and AI provider obligations**.
