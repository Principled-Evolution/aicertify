Here is a comparative analysis of prominent AI regulatory frameworks based on maturity, content quality, and industry recognition, synthesized from the provided search results and global developments:

| AI Regulatory Act | Maturity (1–5) | Content Quality (1–5) | Industry Recognition (1–5) | Key Features | Source Links |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **EU AI Act** | 5 | 5 | 5 | Risk-based classification, prohibited practices (e.g., social scoring), GPAI governance, CE marking for compliance | [PDF Guide](https://www.twobirds.com/-/media/new-website-content/pdfs/capabilities/artificial-intelligence/european-union-artificial-intelligence-act-guide.pdf), [AI Act Explorer](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/ai-act-explorer/) |
| **California AI Transparency Act (SB942)** | 4 | 4 | 4 | Mandates AI-generated content disclosure for systems with >1M monthly users; enforceable Jan 2026 | [BCLP Analysis](https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/us-state-by-state-artificial-intelligence-legislation-snapshot.html) |
| **Colorado AI Consumer Protection Act (SB24-205)** | 4 | 4 | 3 | Requires algorithmic discrimination risk assessments for high-risk AI systems; AG enforcement only | [BCLP Analysis](https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/us-state-by-state-artificial-intelligence-legislation-snapshot.html) |
| **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** | 4 | 5 | 5 | Voluntary standards for trustworthiness, adopted by federal agencies and Fortune 500 firms | [NIST.gov](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework) |
| **Canada’s AI and Data Act (AIDA)** | 3 | 4 | 3 | Prohibits reckless AI use; aligns with EU risk tiers; enforcement via Innovation Ministry | [Carnegie Analysis](https://carnegieendowment.org/2024/03/05/ai-and-product-safety-standards-under-eu-ai-act-pub-91870) |
| **India’s Digital India Act (Draft)** | 2 | 3 | 2 | Focuses on high-risk AI; task force for ethical guidelines; no enforcement timeline | [Global Tracker](https://legalnodes.com/article/global-ai-regulations-tracker) |
| **Connecticut SB 2 (Failed)** | 1 | 3 | 2 | Proposed AI audit requirements for healthcare/employment systems; rejected over innovation concerns | [BCLP Analysis](https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/us-state-by-state-artificial-intelligence-legislation-snapshot.html) |
| **California AB2355 (Enacted)** | 4 | 4 | 3 | Mandates AI disclosure in political ads; enforced by Fair Political Practices Commission | [BCLP Analysis](https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/us-state-by-state-artificial-intelligence-legislation-snapshot.html) |

| **Brazil’s AI Bill (Draft)** | 2 | 3 | 2 | Mirroring EU’s risk tiers; stalled in Congress over biometrics debate | [Global Tracker](https://legalnodes.com/article/global-ai-regulations-tracker) |

### Metrics Explanation  
- **Maturity**: 5 = Fully enacted with enforcement infrastructure; 1 = Proposed/stalled  
- **Content Quality**: 5 = Technically precise with implementation tools; 1 = Vague principles  
- **Industry Recognition**: 5 = Globally referenced; 1 = Limited adoption  

### Key Trends  
1. **EU Dominance**: The EU AI Act’s technical annexes ([Annex III](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/ai-act-explorer/)) set global benchmarks for high-risk systems, influencing Canada’s AIDA and Brazil’s draft bill[2][5].  
2. **US Fragmentation**: California leads with sectoral rules (e.g., SB942 for content transparency), while federal efforts like the AI Bill of Rights remain aspirational[1][4].  
3. **Enforcement Challenges**: Only the EU and Colorado mandate third-party audits for high-risk AI, whereas India and Canada rely on self-assessment[3][4].  

### Methodology  
Ratings derived from:  
- Implementation timelines in legislative texts  
- Granularity of technical requirements (e.g., EU’s Annex IV documentation rules)  
- Adoption by multinational corporations and reference in cross-border contracts
