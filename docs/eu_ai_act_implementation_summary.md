# EU AI Act Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of EU AI Act support in the AICertify framework. It covers the changes made to ensure that AICertify can effectively evaluate AI systems for compliance with the EU AI Act requirements.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Policy Integration Module
- ✅ Identified and listed all rego policy files under the `eu_ai_act` folder
- ✅ Formatted and validated all rego policies using `opa fmt` and `opa check`
- ✅ Added new rego policies to support the EU AI Act, including placeholders for areas without evaluators

### 2. API and Evaluator Integration
- ✅ Updated evaluation functions in `api.py` to accept a `policyCategory` parameter that supports the new option `'eu_ai_act'`
- ✅ Created mechanisms to merge evaluator outputs with the OPA policy evaluation results for EU AI Act

### 3. End-to-End Evaluation Script
- ✅ Created a new evaluation script `debug_policy_evaluation_eu_ai_act.py` that focuses on EU AI Act policies
- ✅ Created a specialized example script `EU_AI_Act_Compliance_Example.py` that demonstrates the new ModelCard interface

### 4. Developer Interface Improvements
- ✅ Designed and implemented a model-card interface to facilitate the input of model metadata and evaluation parameters
- ✅ Updated the developer guide with information about the new ModelCard interface and EU AI Act specific functions

## Key Components Implemented

### ModelCard Interface

The ModelCard interface provides a structured way to document AI models with fields relevant to EU AI Act compliance:

```python
class ModelCard(BaseModel):
    # Basic Information
    model_name: str
    model_version: Optional[str] = None
    model_type: str
    organization: str
    
    # Intended Use
    primary_uses: List[str]
    out_of_scope_uses: Optional[List[str]] = None
    
    # Model Details
    description: str
    model_architecture: Optional[str] = None
    
    # Risk & Mitigation
    ethical_considerations: Optional[List[str]] = None
    limitations: Optional[List[str]] = None
    
    # EU AI Act Compliance Information
    risk_category: Optional[str] = None
    relevant_articles: Optional[List[str]] = None
    # ... and many more fields
```

### EU AI Act Specialized Evaluation

A specialized function for EU AI Act compliance evaluation:

```python
async def evaluate_eu_ai_act_compliance(
    contract: AiCertifyContract,
    focus_areas: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    evaluator_config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    generate_report: bool = True,
    report_format: str = "pdf",
    output_dir: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Implementation
```

### Integration with Contract Creation

Helper functions to create contracts with model cards:

```python
def create_contract_with_model_card(
    application_name: str,
    model_card: ModelCard,
    interactions: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    # ... other parameters
) -> AiCertifyContract:
    # Implementation
```

## Developer Experience Improvements

### Focus Areas for EU AI Act Compliance

Developers can now target specific aspects of EU AI Act compliance:

- `"prohibited_practices"`: Evaluates for manipulative techniques, vulnerability exploitation, social scoring, etc.
- `"documentation"`: Assesses technical documentation requirements
- `"technical_robustness"`: Checks accuracy and factual consistency
- `"fairness"`: Evaluates for bias and discriminatory practices
- ... and more

### Simplified API

The new specialized function `evaluate_eu_ai_act_compliance` provides a simpler entry point for developers:

```python
# Simple evaluation with EU AI Act policies
result = await evaluate_eu_ai_act_compliance(contract)

# Evaluate with specific focus areas
result = await evaluate_eu_ai_act_compliance(
    contract, 
    focus_areas=["prohibited_practices", "documentation"]
)
```

### Comprehensive Documentation

The developer guide has been updated with:
- Detailed information about the ModelCard interface
- Examples of using the specialized EU AI Act compliance evaluation function
- Information about EU AI Act risk categories and requirements
- Practical examples for different domains (healthcare, finance, etc.)

## Next Steps

While the core tasks for EU AI Act compliance evaluation have been completed, there are still opportunities for further enhancements:

1. **Report Improvements**: Enhance the PDF reports with more detailed EU AI Act specific sections
2. **Additional Evaluators**: Develop more specialized evaluators for EU AI Act requirements
3. **Benchmarking**: Create benchmark datasets for validating compliance with different EU AI Act requirements
4. **Integration with External Tools**: Provide integrations with other EU AI Act compliance tools and frameworks
