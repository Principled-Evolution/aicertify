# AICertify Phase 1 Implementation Summary

> **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:** This document provides an overview of the Phase 1 implementation. For detailed architecture and implementation guidance, please refer to the authoritative `MILESTONE_EXPANDED_EVALS.md` document. In case of any conflicts or inconsistencies between this summary and `MILESTONE_EXPANDED_EVALS.md`, the latter should be followed for implementation.

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 1 of the AICertify Systematic Evaluation Framework. Phase 1 focuses on establishing the core evaluator framework and implementing essential evaluators for fairness, content safety, and risk management.

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| BaseEvaluator Interface | ✅ Complete | Standardized interface for all evaluators |
| EvaluationResult Model | ✅ Complete | Standardized result format |
| Report Model | ✅ Complete | Standardized report format |
| FairnessEvaluator | ✅ Complete | Integration with LangFair for fairness assessment |
| ContentSafetyEvaluator | ✅ Complete | Integration with DeepEval for toxicity assessment |
| RiskManagementEvaluator | ✅ Complete | Evaluation of risk documentation completeness |
| ComplianceEvaluator | ✅ Complete | Orchestration of multiple evaluators |
| API Integration | ✅ Complete | Functions for contract evaluation |
| Example Usage | ✅ Complete | Example script demonstrating evaluator usage |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | Detailed documentation of evaluators |
| Unit Tests | ✅ Complete | Tests for all evaluators |

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Standardized Evaluator Interface**
   - Common interface for all evaluators
   - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous evaluation
   - Standardized result format

2. **Fairness Evaluation**
   - Integration with LangFair library
   - Assessment of bias across protected groups
   - Configurable fairness thresholds

3. **Content Safety Evaluation**
   - Integration with DeepEval library
   - Toxicity detection in AI responses
   - Detailed reporting of problematic interactions

4. **Risk Management Evaluation**
   - Assessment of risk documentation completeness
   - Evaluation of key risk management sections
   - Keyword-based analysis of documentation quality

5. **Comprehensive Compliance Evaluation**
   - Orchestration of multiple evaluators
   - Overall compliance determination
   - Report generation in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, PDF)

6. **API Integration**
   - Simplified functions for contract evaluation
   - Support for both Phase 1 evaluators and OPA policies
   - Comprehensive evaluation capabilities

> **Note on Compliance Determination:** As specified in `MILESTONE_EXPANDED_EVALS.md`, evaluators should produce standardized measurements, while domain-specific compliance thresholds should be defined in OPA policies. Refer to the expanded evaluations document for the authoritative architectural approach regarding the separation of evaluator measurements and policy-based compliance determination.
