<think>The user is asking about replacing mocks for the langfair and deepeval evaluators with real evaluators, using the APIs documented in the attached files and references. Let me analyze what needs to be done.

First, I'll look at the current implementation of the Content Safety and Fairness evaluators to understand how they're currently using (or mocking) these libraries.

From the provided code, I can see:

1. `ContentSafetyEvaluator` in `aicertify/evaluators/content_safety_evaluator.py` tries to import deepeval and specifically the `ToxicityMetric` from `deepeval.metrics` and `LLMTestCase` from `deepeval.test_case`. It sets a flag `DEEPEVAL_AVAILABLE` to indicate whether the library is available.

2. `FairnessEvaluator` in `aicertify/evaluators/fairness_evaluator.py` similarly tries to import various components from langfair, including `CounterfactualMetrics`, `SentimentBias`, `BLEUSimilarity`, `RougeScoreSimilarity`, and `StereotypeMetrics`. It sets a flag `LANGFAIR_AVAILABLE` to indicate whether the library is available.

Currently, both evaluators have fallback behavior when these libraries aren't available, but they attempt to use the actual libraries if they are available. The issue seems to be that the referenced libraries might not be properly installed or configured.

Looking at the provided documentation:

1. For LangFair, I can see examples of using `CounterfactualMetrics`, `StereotypeMetrics`, and various other metrics. The documentation shows how to initialize these classes and how to use them for evaluation.

2. For DeepEval, we have attached documentation but I don't see specific content safety or toxicity evaluation examples in the provided excerpts.

To replace the mocks with real evaluators, we need to:

1. Ensure the libraries are properly installed and available
2. Update the implementation to properly use the libraries' APIs
3. Handle any edge cases or errors that might occur
4. Ensure the integration fits into the existing AICertify framework

Let me outline the changes needed for each evaluator.</think># Implementing Real Evaluators for LangFair and DeepEval

Based on the documentation provided and analyzing your codebase, here's what needs to be done to replace the mocks with real evaluators:

## 1. Installation Requirements

First, ensure both libraries are properly installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install langfair deepeval
```

These should be added to your project's requirements.txt file as well.

## 2. LangFair Integration (FairnessEvaluator)

Your current FairnessEvaluator implementation already has the structure to use LangFair, but needs some updates based on the documentation:

### Key Updates:

1. **Configure CounterfactualMetrics properly**:
   - The LangFair documentation shows CounterfactualMetrics needs proper initialization with specific metrics
   - Update the `_evaluate_counterfactual` method to better align with LangFair's API expectations

2. **Stereotype evaluation improvement**:
   - The current implementation calls `gender_bias` and `race_bias` methods directly, but the API might expect different patterns
   - Consider using the AutoEval class from LangFair for more comprehensive evaluation

3. **Add proper error handling** for edge cases in the LangFair API

## 3. DeepEval Integration (ContentSafetyEvaluator)

Your ContentSafetyEvaluator is already set up to use DeepEval, but needs refinement:

### Key Updates:

1. **ToxicityMetric configuration**:
   - Ensure proper initialization with all required parameters
   - Update threshold handling to align with DeepEval's expectations

2. **LLMTestCase setup**:
   - Make sure test cases are constructed correctly with all required fields
   - Handle DeepEval's requirements for input/output formatting

3. **Error handling improvements** for DeepEval-specific exceptions

## 4. Implementation Example for FairnessEvaluator

Here's how you might update the FairnessEvaluator to use LangFair more effectively:

```python
def _initialize(self) -> None:
    """Initialize the fairness evaluator with LangFair components."""
    # Set the name for this evaluator
    self.config._config["name"] = "fairness"

    if not LANGFAIR_AVAILABLE:
        logger.warning("LangFair is not available. Fairness evaluation will be limited.")
        return

    # Initialize metrics with proper configuration
    self.sentiment_bias = SentimentBias()
    self.bleu_similarity = BLEUSimilarity()
    self.rouge_similarity = RougeScoreSimilarity()

    # Initialize counterfactual metrics
    self.counterfactual_metrics = CounterfactualMetrics(metrics=[
        self.sentiment_bias,
        self.bleu_similarity,
        self.rouge_similarity
    ])

    # Initialize stereotype metrics
    self.stereotype_metrics = StereotypeMetrics()

    logger.info("Fairness evaluator initialized with LangFair metrics")
```

## 5. Implementation Example for ContentSafetyEvaluator

For the ContentSafetyEvaluator, you might enhance it like this:

```python
def _evaluate_interaction(self, input_text: str, output_text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Evaluate a single interaction using DeepEval ToxicityMetric.

    Args:
        input_text: The user input text
        output_text: The AI response text

    Returns:
        Dictionary with evaluation results
    """
    try:
        # Create a test case for DeepEval with proper formatting
        test_case = LLMTestCase(
            input=input_text,
            actual_output=output_text,
            expected_output=""  # Not needed for toxicity
        )

        # Run toxicity evaluation with proper error handling
        self.toxicity_metric.measure(test_case)

        return {
            "toxicity_score": self.toxicity_metric.score,
            "passed": self.toxicity_metric.passed,
            "reason": self.toxicity_metric.reason or "No issues detected",
            "details": getattr(self.toxicity_metric, "details", {})
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"DeepEval toxicity evaluation error: {str(e)}")
        return {
            "error": str(e),
            "passed": False,
            "toxicity_score": 1.0,  # Assume worst-case for errors
            "reason": f"Evaluation error: {str(e)}"
        }
```

## 6. Configuration Management

Both evaluators would benefit from enhanced configuration management:

1. Make thresholds configurable through the evaluator config
2. Allow configuration of which specific metrics to use
3. Set up any API keys or environment variables needed by these libraries

## 7. Testing Approach

To ensure the integration works properly:

1. Create isolated tests that focus specifically on the LangFair and DeepEval integration
2. Start with simple test cases that verify basic functionality
3. Add more complex test cases that check edge cases and error handling
4. Create integration tests that verify the evaluators work within the larger AICertify framework
