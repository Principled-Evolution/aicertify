## Test Execution Log

### Category 1: Policy Loading and Validation

#### PL-01: Verify all EU AI Act rego policies are found by policy loader
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Execution Date**: March 7, 2025
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Created test script `test_eu_ai_act_policies.py` to verify policy loading
  2. Found all policies in EU AI Act directory (30 policy files)
  3. Verified that policy_loader.get_policies_by_category("eu_ai_act") loads all policies
- **Observed Results**: All 30 EU AI Act policies were successfully found and loaded
- **Issues Encountered**: Initial path comparison issue was fixed by comparing policy filenames only
- **Notes**: The policy loader correctly maps "eu_ai_act" to "international/eu_ai_act"

#### PL-02: Check that rego policies pass validation with `opa check`
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Execution Date**: March 7, 2025
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Created test script `test_eu_ai_act_policy_validation.py` to validate policies
  2. Ran `opa check` on all 30 EU AI Act rego policies
  3. Verified validation results for each policy
- **Observed Results**: 29 out of 30 policies passed validation, 1 policy failed
- **Issues Encountered**: 
  - `eu_fairness.rego` failed validation with 7 errors
  - All errors are related to undefined functions from global common modules
  - The undefined functions include:
    - `data.global.v1.common.fairness.gender_bias_detected`
    - `data.global.v1.common.fairness.racial_bias_detected`
    - `data.global.v1.common.content_safety.toxicity_below_threshold`
    - `data.global.v1.common.fairness.get_fairness_score`
    - `data.global.v1.common.content_safety.get_toxicity_score`
- **Notes**: The failures appear to be due to missing dependencies in the global common modules. The policy is trying to use functions that are not defined or not accessible during validation.

#### PL-03: Verify policy folder mapping works with `policy_category="eu_ai_act"`
- **Status**: ✅ PASS (indirectly verified by PL-01)
- **Execution Date**: March 7, 2025
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Observed that policy_loader.get_policies_by_category("eu_ai_act") correctly maps to "international/eu_ai_act"
  2. This was verified during PL-01 test execution
- **Observed Results**: Special handling for EU AI Act works correctly in policy_loader.py
- **Issues Encountered**: None
- **Notes**: From the logs: "Found policies using subcategory match international/eu_ai_act"

#### PL-04: Test policy loader's handling of placeholder policies
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Execution Date**: March 7, 2025
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Created test script `test_eu_ai_act_placeholder_policies.py` to identify placeholder policies
  2. Loaded all EU AI Act policies and checked for placeholder indicators
  3. Extracted metadata from policies to check status field
- **Observed Results**: 
  - Successfully identified 26 placeholder policies and 4 non-placeholder policies
  - Only one policy (`manipulation.rego`) had a proper status field with "PLACEHOLDER - Pending detailed implementation"
  - Most placeholder policies had empty status fields
- **Issues Encountered**: Most placeholder policies don't have a proper status field in their metadata
- **Notes**: The policy loader correctly loads placeholder policies, but the policies themselves could be improved with better metadata

### Category 2: ModelCard Interface

- **Observed Results**: Successfully created a minimal ModelCard with required fields
- **Issues Encountered**: None when using Poetry environment
- **Notes**: Running with `poetry run python test_model_card.py` succeeds

#### MC-02: Create comprehensive ModelCard with all fields
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Execution Date**: March 7, 2025
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Created a comprehensive ModelCard with all fields using Poetry environment
  2. Verified that all fields were set correctly
- **Observed Results**: Successfully created a comprehensive ModelCard with all fields

- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Execution Date**: March 7, 2025
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Tested the helper function for creating ModelCards using Poetry environment
  2. Verified that the function creates a valid ModelCard with required and optional fields
- **Observed Results**: Helper function successfully creates a valid ModelCard
- **Issues Encountered**: None when using Poetry environment

#### MC-05: Test `get_compliance_level` for different ModelCard completeness levels
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Execution Date**: March 7, 2025
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Tested the compliance level calculation function using Poetry environment
  2. Created minimal, partial, and comprehensive ModelCards
  3. Verified that the function returns the appropriate level for each ModelCard
- **Observed Results**: Function correctly returns "minimal", "partial", or "comprehensive" based on ModelCard completeness

## Issues Tracking

| Issue ID | Related Test | Description | Severity | Status | Resolution |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|--------|------------|
| PL-02-1 | PL-02 | `eu_fairness.rego` fails validation due to undefined functions from global common modules | Medium | Open | Need to implement or fix references to global common functions |
| PL-04-1 | PL-04 | Most placeholder policies have empty status fields in metadata | Low | Open | Update placeholder policies with proper status fields |
| EI-01-1 | EI-01, E2E-01, E2E-02, DX-01 | Missing `FactualConsistencyMetric` in deepeval 2.5.0 | High | Open | Either upgrade deepeval or update code to use available metrics like `FaithfulnessMetric` |

## Conclusion

Testing is in progress with mixed results. The ModelCard interface is working perfectly when run in the Poetry-managed environment, but we've encountered an issue with the deepeval package. The `FactualConsistencyMetric` class that several components depend on is not available in the installed version (2.5.0).

To proceed with further testing, we need to either:
1. Upgrade deepeval to a version that includes `FactualConsistencyMetric`
2. Update the code to use an alternative metric like `FaithfulnessMetric` that is available in the current version

The policy loading mechanism for EU AI Act policies is working correctly, with some minor issues in policy validation and metadata that should be addressed.
