## Introduction

The EU AI Act requires comprehensive assessment of AI systems across multiple dimensions, including prohibited practices, high-risk system requirements, transparency, data governance, human oversight, and technical robustness. Our current policy mapping document (`eu_ai_act_opa_policy_mapping.md`) identifies several gaps in our OPA policy coverage.

This analysis explores how integrating additional open-source evaluators can help address these gaps, focusing on practical implementations that align with AICertify's architecture and developer experience goals.

## Current Integration Status

AICertify currently integrates with the following evaluation frameworks:

1. **LangFair** - For fairness evaluations, bias detection, and stereotype metrics
2. **DeepEval** - For various LLM evaluation metrics

These integrations provide coverage for some aspects of the EU AI Act requirements, particularly in the areas of fairness, bias, and content safety. However, significant gaps remain in areas such as prohibited practices, technical documentation, human oversight, and cybersecurity.

## Gap Analysis and Evaluator Mapping

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on the gap analysis, we recommend implementing the following new evaluator integrations:

### 1. HuggingFace Model Cards Integration

**Description**: Integrate HuggingFace Model Cards standards to assess technical documentation compliance.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create a `ModelCardEvaluator` class that checks for the presence and completeness of model documentation
- Implement checks for required sections: model details, intended uses, limitations, bias, ethical considerations
- Generate compliance scores based on documentation completeness and quality

**Benefits**:
- Addresses documentation requirements in Articles 11, 12, and 53
- Leverages established industry standards for model documentation
- Provides actionable recommendations for improving documentation

### 2. Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) Integration

**Description**: Integrate ART to evaluate model robustness against adversarial attacks and errors.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create an `AdversarialRobustnessEvaluator` class that interfaces with ART
- Implement robustness tests for different types of adversarial attacks
- Generate robustness scores and vulnerability reports

**Benefits**:
- Addresses robustness requirements in Article 15
- Provides concrete metrics for technical robustness
- Helps identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities

### 3. LangGraph OpenEval Integration

**Description**: Implement LangGraph-based evaluators for assessing human oversight capabilities.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create a `HumanOversightEvaluator` class using LangGraph's evaluation framework
- Implement checks for human intervention points, oversight mechanisms, and automation bias
- Generate compliance scores for human oversight requirements

**Benefits**:
- Addresses human oversight requirements in Article 14
- Leverages LangGraph's capabilities for evaluating complex agent interactions
- Provides actionable insights for improving human oversight

### 4. Agent Security Bench (ASB) Integration

**Description**: Integrate ASB to evaluate security aspects of AI agents and systems.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create an `AgentSecurityEvaluator` class that interfaces with ASB
- Implement security tests for different attack vectors (DPI, OPI, etc.)
- Generate security assessment reports and recommendations

**Benefits**:
- Addresses security requirements across multiple articles
- Provides comprehensive security testing for AI agents
- Helps identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities

## Priority Implementation Plan

Based on the EU AI Act requirements and the identified gaps, we recommend the following implementation priorities:

### Phase 1 (Immediate)

1. **Extend DeepEval Integration**:
   - Implement custom G-Eval criteria for prohibited practices detection
   - Enhance hallucination metrics for accuracy assessment
   - Add bias detection for biometric categorization

2. **HuggingFace Model Cards Integration**:
   - Implement basic documentation assessment capabilities
   - Focus on technical documentation requirements in Article 11

### Phase 2 (Short-term)

1. **Adversarial Robustness Toolbox Integration**:
   - Implement basic robustness testing capabilities
   - Focus on error robustness and accuracy requirements

2. **LangGraph OpenEval Integration**:
   - Implement basic human oversight assessment
   - Focus on intervention capabilities and automation bias

### Phase 3 (Medium-term)

1. **Agent Security Bench Integration**:
   - Implement comprehensive security testing
   - Focus on GPAI systemic risk assessment

2. **Custom Evaluators for Remaining Gaps**:
   - Develop specialized evaluators for record-keeping and automated logs
   - Implement downstream transparency assessment for GPAI

## Conclusion

Integrating these additional evaluators will significantly enhance AICertify's ability to assess compliance with the EU AI Act requirements. By prioritizing implementations based on the criticality of the gaps and the ease of integration, we can provide a comprehensive compliance assessment framework that helps developers navigate the complex regulatory landscape.

The proposed approach leverages existing open-source tools and frameworks, aligning with AICertify's architecture and developer experience goals. By implementing these integrations, AICertify will be well-positioned to support organizations in achieving and maintaining compliance with the EU AI Act.
