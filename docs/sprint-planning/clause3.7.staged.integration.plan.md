AICertify Integration: Staged Implementation Plan
Based on our initial work and the blueprint in clause3.7.integration-approach.md, I'll outline a staged implementation plan to achieve the acceptance criteria. This approach ensures we build a solid foundation at each step.
Current Progress Assessment
âœ… Stage 1: Contract Creation
Successfully implemented the contract creation workflow
Fixed import issues in contract_models.py
Created, saved and loaded contracts with proper structure
Implemented basic debugging and error handling
Staged Implementation Plan
Stage 2: Evaluation Core Implementation
Our next steps focus on the evaluation components:
Evaluator Module Fixes
2. Create Simple Evaluator Interface
Update Evaluator Implementation Test
Stage 3: Policy Selection Implementation
Define Policy Categories
Implement Policy Selection
Create Policy Selection Test
Stage 4: Results Generation
Implement Basic Results Structure
Add Report Generation
Stage 5: Integration Example Update
Once all the above components are working correctly, update the example to demonstrate the full workflow:
Implementation Sequence
I recommend implementing in this order:
Basic Evaluator Fixes:
Fix imports in evaluation-related modules
Create a stripped-down evaluator that doesn't depend on external libraries
Policy Selection:
Implement the policy selection interface
Create sample policies that work even without complex evaluators
3. Results Structure:
Implement the results structure that matches the contract model
Ensure results can be serialized/deserialized properly
Integration Example:
Update the example to use the new components
Add proper error handling and feedback
This approach allows us to progress systematically, with each stage building on the previous one's success. Each stage can be independently tested and verified before moving to the next.
