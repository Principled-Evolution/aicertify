This is a comprehensive request that involves analyzing the Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py file, understanding the OPA Rego files it interacts with, and planning a systematic evaluation approach within the AICertify library. The request also involves considering integrations with other tools like LangFair and DeepEval, and planning a roadmap.

break down of what we need to do:

1. Analyze Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py to understand how it interacts with OPA policies
2. Review the Rego files it needs to comply with (fairness, risk_management, transparency, etc.)
3. Consider how LangFair is implemented for fairness and toxicity evaluations
4. Explore other evaluation tools like DeepEval and others from the scanners list
5. Develop a plan for a systematic evaluation approach within AICertify
6. Consider hooks or interfaces for cloud vendors and other validation systems
7. Prioritize additions for the first release based on meaningfulness and ease of implementation
8. Consider the overall purpose and context of the AICertify project in light of the go-to-market plan

what we understand:

The AICertify project is an open-source AI compliance and certification framework that uses Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies for validating AI systems. The framework is experiencing issues with policy loading, particularly with the directory structure, which is affecting the Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py example.

The OPA policies are organized in a hierarchical structure with categories like global, international (which includes eu_ai_act), and industry-specific (which includes healthcare), each with their own versions and policy areas.

The Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py example demonstrates a complex medical diagnostic system with multiple specialized AI agents and is attempting to evaluate these agents against OPA policies, but encounters issues with policy evaluation.

Now, let me think about the plan for a systematic evaluation approach

# AICertify Systematic Evaluation Framework: Analysis & Strategic Plan

After analyzing the Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py example and related OPA policies, I've developed a comprehensive plan for implementing a systematic evaluation approach within the AICertify library. This plan aims to make compliance assessment straightforward for developers while maintaining the project's integrity and purpose.

## I. Current State Analysis

### Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py Overview
The example demonstrates a multi-agent medical diagnostic system with:
- Multiple specialist agents (Neurology, Cardiology, Gastroenterology, Primary Care)
- Contract creation and validation
- Integration with AICertify for policy evaluation
- Currently facing issues with EU AI Act policy evaluations (fairness, risk_management, transparency)

### Key Requirements from OPA Policies
Based on examining the Rego files, the evaluation system needs to assess:

1. **Fairness**: Gender/racial bias detection, stereotype evaluation, bias metrics
2. **Risk Management**: Risk assessment completeness, mitigation measures, monitoring systems
3. **Transparency**: Documentation completeness, disclosure requirements
4. **Toxicity**: Content safety evaluation via standardized metrics

## II. Systematic Evaluation Approach

### A. Core Architecture Principles

1. **Modular Evaluator Design**
   - Independent evaluator components per compliance domain
   - Standard interface across all evaluators
   - Composable evaluation pipelines

2. **Data Collection Standardization**
   - Define common input schema for all evaluators
   - Implement hooks for both static and runtime data capture
   - Support batch and streaming evaluation modes

3. **Unified Reporting Framework**
   - Consistent report structure across evaluators
   - Machine-readable output (JSON) with human-readable views (Markdown/PDF)
   - Traceable evidence collection and storage

```python
# Proposed Evaluator Interface
class BaseEvaluator:
    """Base class for all compliance evaluators"""
    
    def evaluate(self, data: Dict) -> EvaluationResult:
        """Evaluate compliance based on input data"""
        pass
    
    def generate_report(self, results: List[EvaluationResult], 
                        format: str = "json") -> Report:
        """Generate standardized compliance report"""
        pass
```

### B. Implementation Strategy for Key Domains

#### 1. Fairness Evaluation (LangFair Integration)

```python
class FairnessEvaluator(BaseEvaluator):
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        self.metrics = self._initialize_metrics(config)
        # Default metrics include gender bias, racial bias, and toxicity
        
    def evaluate(self, data):
        # Use LangFair for counterfactual fairness assessment
        from langfair.metrics.counterfactual import CounterfactualMetrics
        from langfair.metrics.counterfactual.metrics import SentimentBias
        
        metrics = CounterfactualMetrics(metrics=[SentimentBias()])
        return metrics.evaluate(data["interactions"])
```

#### 2. Risk Management Evaluation

```python
class RiskManagementEvaluator(BaseEvaluator):
    def evaluate(self, data):
        # Assess risk management system completeness
        risk_assessment = self._evaluate_risk_assessment(data)
        mitigation_measures = self._evaluate_mitigation_measures(data)
        monitoring_system = self._evaluate_monitoring_system(data)
        
        # Return structured evaluation results
        return {
            "risk_assessment": risk_assessment,
            "mitigation_measures": mitigation_measures,
            "monitoring_system": monitoring_system,
            "compliant": all([
                risk_assessment["completeness"] >= 0.7,
                mitigation_measures["completeness"] >= 0.7,
                monitoring_system["completeness"] >= 0.7
            ])
        }
```

#### 3. Transparency Evaluation

```python
class TransparencyEvaluator(BaseEvaluator):
    def evaluate(self, data):
        # Check for documentation and disclosures
        documentation = self._evaluate_documentation(data)
        
        # Evaluate if model outputs provide sufficient explanations
        explanation_quality = self._evaluate_explanations(
            data["interactions"]
        )
        
        return {
            "documentation_completeness": documentation["completeness"],
            "explanation_quality": explanation_quality,
            "compliant": documentation["completeness"] >= 0.7 and 
                         explanation_quality >= 0.6
        }
```

#### 4. Toxicity & Content Safety (DeepEval Integration)

```python
class ContentSafetyEvaluator(BaseEvaluator):
    def evaluate(self, data):
        from deepeval.metrics import ToxicityMetric
        
        # Create and run toxicity metric
        toxicity_metric = ToxicityMetric(threshold=0.1)
        
        # For each interaction in the data
        results = []
        for interaction in data["interactions"]:
            # Create test case
            test_case = self._create_test_case(interaction)
            toxicity_metric.measure(test_case)
            results.append({
                "score": toxicity_metric.score,
                "reason": toxicity_metric.reason,
                "passed": toxicity_metric.score <= 0.1
            })
            
        return {
            "results": results,
            "compliant": all(r["passed"] for r in results)
        }
```

### C. Integration Points

1. **Data Collection Hooks**

```python
# In agent code or middleware
def capture_interaction(input_text, output_text, metadata=None):
    """Capture a single interaction for later evaluation"""
    interaction = {
        "input_text": input_text,
        "output_text": output_text,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "metadata": metadata or {}
    }
    AICertify.collect_interaction(interaction)
```

2. **Cloud Vendor Integration**

```python
# Azure AI Content Safety integration
class AzureContentSafetyEvaluator(ContentSafetyEvaluator):
    def __init__(self, api_key, endpoint):
        super().__init__()
        self.client = ContentSafetyClient(endpoint, AzureKeyCredential(api_key))
        
    def evaluate(self, data):
        results = []
        for interaction in data["interactions"]:
            response = self.client.analyze_text(
                text=interaction["output_text"]
            )
            results.append(self._format_result(response))
        return {"results": results, "compliant": self._is_compliant(results)}
```

## III. Developer Experience Enhancements

### A. Simple Integration API

```python
# Example usage in an application
from aicertify import ComplianceEvaluator, EvaluatorConfig

        "risk_management",    # Built-in risk management evaluator
        "transparency",       # Built-in transparency evaluator
        "content_safety"      # Built-in content safety evaluator
    ],
    config=EvaluatorConfig(
        fairness={
            "use_langfair": True,
            "counterfactual_metrics": ["sentiment_bias", "bleu_similarity"]
        },
