Analyze the additional information provided to better understand the intent and requirements for AICertify.

Based on the new information:

1. The primary intent of AICertify is to provide an easy-to-use, extensible, composable evaluation library that produces industry and regulatory aligned assessment reports.

2. The target applications span across various domains and countries, requiring flexibility in evaluation criteria.

3. OPA policy integration is a core "partnering" feature, enabling modularity and transparency in evaluations.

4. The architecture needs to be composable, extensible, and pluggable to allow for integration of domain-specific evaluators or data sources.

5. The only mandatory element in the evaluation pipeline is the "Interaction" element of the contract, as all systems seeking evaluation do so based on interactions with humans or other systems.

6. The focus is on regulatory compliance, particularly how system behavior impacts humans and reducing risks of negative impacts.

7. The architecture and design need to support this extensibility, and the Phase 1 documentation and marketing should align with the roadmap.

8. Examples include Loan-Application-Evaluator.py and CareerCoachAI.py, showing different application domains that would need evaluation.

9. The OPA policy structure document shows a hierarchical organization of policies by domains, categories, and versions, supporting the modular nature of the framework.

Given this context, we propose a composable contract architecture and implementation approach for Phase 1 that:
- Ensures the core "Interaction" element is preserved
- Allows for extensibility and pluggability
- Supports the OPA policy integration
- Enables domain-specific evaluators
- Facilitates regulatory compliance reporting
- Can work across different application types (like medical, financial, career coaching)

# AICertify Composable Contract Architecture and Implementation Approach for Phase 1

After a comprehensive review of the requirements, examples, and implemented components, I'll outline a composable contract architecture for Phase 1 that aligns with AICertify's core intent as an extensible evaluation framework supporting regulatory compliance across diverse domains.

## Core Architectural Principles

The architecture for AICertify should embody these key principles:

1. **Composable Evaluation Pipeline**: A modular pipeline where evaluators can be added, removed, or customized.
2. **Domain-Agnostic Core**: A central framework that works across industries while supporting domain-specific extensions.
3. **Extensible Contract Model**: A flexible data model that can accommodate varying metadata needs.
4. **Transparent Policy Integration**: Seamless connection to OPA policies organized by domain and category.
5. **Pluggable Data Sources**: Support for diverse interaction data sources and formats.

## Composable Contract Architecture

### 2. Evaluator Interface

```python
class EvaluatorInterface:
    """
    Interface for all evaluators in the AICertify framework.
    
    Designed for extensibility to allow domain-specific implementations
    while maintaining a consistent API.
    """
    
    def evaluate(self, contract_data: dict) -> EvaluationResult:
        """Evaluate contract against criteria"""
        pass
    
    async def evaluate_async(self, contract_data: dict) -> EvaluationResult:
        """Asynchronously evaluate contract"""
        pass
    
    def apply_policies(self, evaluation_result: EvaluationResult, 
                       policy_category: str) -> PolicyResult:
        """Apply policies to evaluation results"""
        pass
    
    def generate_report(self, evaluation_result: EvaluationResult,
                        policy_result: PolicyResult,
                        format: str) -> Report:
        """Generate standardized report"""
        pass
```

### 3. Evaluator Registry and Factory

```python
class EvaluatorRegistry:
    """Registry for available evaluators."""
    
    def register_evaluator(self, domain: str, evaluator_class: Type[BaseEvaluator]):
        """Register an evaluator for a specific domain"""
        pass
    
    def get_evaluator(self, domain: str, config: dict = None) -> BaseEvaluator:
        """Get an evaluator instance for a domain"""
        pass
    
    def list_available_evaluators(self) -> List[str]:
        """List all available evaluators"""
        pass
```

### 4. Composite Evaluator Pattern

```python
class CompositeEvaluator(BaseEvaluator):
    """Composite evaluator that orchestrates multiple evaluators."""
    
    def add_evaluator(self, evaluator: BaseEvaluator):
        """Add an evaluator to the pipeline"""
        pass
    
    def remove_evaluator(self, evaluator_name: str):
        """Remove an evaluator from the pipeline"""
        pass
    
    def evaluate(self, contract_data: dict) -> Dict[str, EvaluationResult]:
        """Run all evaluators and aggregate results"""
        pass
```

## Implementation Approach for Phase 1

### 1. Contract Data Model Enhancement

Starting with the existing contract model, extend it to support:

```python
class AICertifyContract(BaseModel):
    """Enhanced contract model for extensibility."""
    
    # Basic contract information (existing)
    contract_id: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid.uuid4)
    application_name: str
    creation_date: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    
    # Enhanced model information
    model_info: Dict[str, Any]
    
    # Core interactions (mandatory)
    interactions: List[Interaction]
    
    # Extensible context (domain-specific)
    context: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    
    # Regulatory and compliance context
    compliance_context: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    
    # Extension point for domain-specific validation
    @root_validator
    def validate_domain_specific(cls, values):
        """Validate domain-specific requirements if validator exists"""
        domain = values.get("context", {}).get("domain")
        if domain and domain in DOMAIN_VALIDATORS:
            DOMAIN_VALIDATORS[domain](values)
        return values
```

### 2. Evaluator Configuration System

```python
class EvaluatorConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configurable parameters for evaluators."""
    
    # Common configuration
    report_formats: List[str] = ["markdown", "json", "pdf"]
    
    # Configuration for evaluator behavior, NOT for thresholds
    # Thresholds are defined in OPA policies, not in evaluator configs
    fairness: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    content_safety: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    risk_management: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    
    # Extensible for domain-specific config
    __root__: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    
    def for_domain(self, domain: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get configuration for a specific domain"""
        return self.__root__.get(domain, {})
```

### 3. Policy Integration Architecture

Implement a modular policy loading and integration system:

```python
class PolicyResolver:
    """Resolves appropriate policies based on contract attributes."""
    
    def resolve_policies(self, contract: AICertifyContract) -> List[str]:
        """Determine applicable policies from contract content"""
        policies = []
        
        # Base policies applicable to all contracts
        policies.extend(self._get_base_policies())
        
        # Domain-specific policies
        if domain := contract.context.get("domain"):
            policies.extend(self._get_domain_policies(domain))
        
        # Jurisdiction-specific policies
        if jurisdictions := contract.compliance_context.get("jurisdictions"):
            for jurisdiction in jurisdictions:
                policies.extend(self._get_jurisdiction_policies(jurisdiction))
        
        return policies
```

### 4. API Integration Layer

Design a unified API that supports the core Phase 1 evaluators while enabling extensions:

```python
async def evaluate_contract_comprehensive(
    contract: AICertifyContract,
    evaluator_config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    policy_categories: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    additional_evaluators: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    report_format: str = "markdown",
    output_dir: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Comprehensive evaluation of a contract with extensibility.
    
    Args:
        contract: Contract to evaluate
        evaluator_config: Configuration for evaluators (behavior only, not thresholds)
        policy_categories: OPA policy categories to apply (contain domain-specific thresholds)
        additional_evaluators: Additional domain-specific evaluators to use
        report_format: Output format for reports
        output_dir: Directory to save reports
        
    Returns:
        Evaluation results and report paths
    """
    # Initialize comprehensive evaluator
    config = EvaluatorConfig(**(evaluator_config or {}))
    evaluator = ComplianceEvaluator(config=config)
    
    # Add core Phase 1 evaluators
    # These are always included
    
    # Add additional domain-specific evaluators if specified
    if additional_evaluators:
        for evaluator_name in additional_evaluators:
            if evaluator_name in EVALUATOR_REGISTRY:
                evaluator.add_evaluator(
                    EVALUATOR_REGISTRY.get_evaluator(evaluator_name, config)
                )
    
    # Resolve applicable policies
    resolver = PolicyResolver()
    if not policy_categories:
        # Auto-detect from contract content
        policy_categories = resolver.resolve_policies(contract)
    
    # Run evaluation - produces standardized measurements
    results = await evaluator.evaluate_async(contract.dict())
    
    # Apply policies - interprets measurements using domain-specific thresholds
    policy_results = evaluator.apply_policies(results, policy_categories)
    
    # Generate and save report
    report = evaluator.generate_report(
        results, policy_results, format=report_format
    )
    
    # Return results and report info
    return {
        "results": results,
        "policy_results": policy_results,
        "report": report.content,
        "report_path": _save_report(report, output_dir) if output_dir else None
    }
```

## Domain Integration Strategy

To support various domains while maintaining a clean architecture:

1. **Domain Adapter Pattern**: Create adapters for domain-specific evaluation:

```python
class HealthcareEvaluatorAdapter(BaseEvaluator):
    """Adapter for healthcare-specific evaluation."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Initialize healthcare-specific components
        
    def evaluate(self, contract_data: dict) -> EvaluationResult:
        # Extract healthcare-specific context
        patient_data = contract_data.get("context", {}).get("patient_data")
        medical_context = contract_data.get("context", {}).get("medical_context")
        
        # Apply healthcare-specific evaluations - produces objective measurements
        # but does NOT apply domain-specific thresholds
        
        return healthcare_specific_result
```

2. **Domain Registration System**:

```python
# In initialization
EVALUATOR_REGISTRY.register_evaluator("healthcare", HealthcareEvaluatorAdapter)
EVALUATOR_REGISTRY.register_evaluator("finance", FinanceEvaluatorAdapter)
EVALUATOR_REGISTRY.register_evaluator("legal", LegalEvaluatorAdapter)
```

3. **Domain Validators**:

```python
def validate_healthcare_contract(values: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Validate healthcare-specific contract requirements."""
    context = values.get("context", {})
    if not context.get("risk_documentation"):
        raise ValueError("Healthcare contracts must include risk documentation")
    # More validations...
    return values

# Register validators
DOMAIN_VALIDATORS["healthcare"] = validate_healthcare_contract
DOMAIN_VALIDATORS["finance"] = validate_finance_contract
```

## Development Roadmap for Phase 1

   - Implement configuration system
   - Create developer-friendly entry points

## Implementation for Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py

For the medical diagnosis example, the implementation would follow this pattern:

```python
# Extract the medical context
medical_context = {
    "domain": "healthcare",
    "specialty": "multi-specialist-diagnosis",
    "patient_data": {
        "demographics": {...},
        "medical_history": {...}
    },
    "risk_documentation": "...",
    "governance_info": {
        "specialist_qualification": {...},
        "diagnostic_protocols": {...}
    }
}

# Create contract with enhanced context
contract = create_contract(
    application_name="Medical Diagnosis Session",
    model_info={...},
    interactions=captured_interactions,
    context=medical_context,
    compliance_context={
        "jurisdictions": ["us", "eu"],
        "frameworks": ["hipaa", "eu_ai_act"]
    }
)

# Evaluate WITHOUT customized thresholds - evaluators produce standard measurements
results = await evaluate_contract_comprehensive(
    contract=contract,
    # NO custom evaluator thresholds here
    policy_categories=["healthcare", "eu_ai_act"],  # Domain-specific policies contain the thresholds
    report_format="pdf",
    output_dir=contract_storage
)
```

## OPA Policy Customization

The domain-specific thresholds would be encoded in OPA policies like:

```rego
package healthcare.diagnostic_safety

import rego.v1
import data.common_rules

# Healthcare-specific thresholds defined in the policy
healthcare_fairness_threshold := 0.8  # Higher threshold for healthcare
patient_safety_threshold := 0.95
diagnostic_accuracy_threshold := 0.9

# Determine compliance based on domain-specific thresholds
is_compliant if {
    input.evaluation.fairness_score >= healthcare_fairness_threshold
    input.evaluation.safety_score >= patient_safety_threshold
    input.evaluation.diagnostic_accuracy >= diagnostic_accuracy_threshold
}

compliance_report := {
    "policy_name": "Healthcare Diagnostic Safety",
    "compliant": is_compliant,
    "reason": reason,
    "recommendations": recommendations
}
```

## Conclusion

This composable contract architecture for Phase 1 provides:

1. **Extensibility**: Domain-specific evaluators can be easily integrated.
2. **Composability**: Evaluators can be combined for comprehensive assessment.
3. **Flexibility**: The contract model can accommodate varying metadata needs.
4. **Transparency**: Clear integration with OPA policies.
5. **Developer Experience**: Simple API for common use cases with hooks for customization.

The architecture enables AICertify to fulfill its core intent as an easy-to-use, extensible evaluation framework supporting regulatory compliance across diverse domains. It establishes a foundation that can evolve to meet future requirements while maintaining backward compatibility and supporting the roadmap outlined in the milestone document.

According to the AICertify vision:

1. Phase 1 evaluators (FairnessEvaluator, ContentSafetyEvaluator, RiskManagementEvaluator) do the evaluation and generate scores
2. OPA policies determine if those scores are compliant based on domain-specific thresholds
3. The evaluators shouldn't have variable thresholds; instead, the OPA policies should interpret the results differently based on the domain

So, rather than setting different thresholds in the evaluators themselves, we should:
1. Have evaluators produce consistent, normalized outputs
2. Use OPA policies to interpret those outputs with domain-specific thresholds
3. The overall compliance would be determined by the policies, not by the evaluators

Evaluator Configuration vs. OPA Policies in AICertify

In AICertify's intended architecture:

1. **Evaluators produce standardized measurements** - They calculate objective metrics about interactions, content safety, fairness, etc.

2. **OPA policies interpret these measurements** - The policies contain the domain-specific thresholds and determine compliance based on context

3. **Compliance determination happens in policies, not evaluators** - The same evaluation results might be compliant in one domain but non-compliant in another


# Evaluate WITHOUT customized thresholds - evaluators produce standard measurements

## Architecture Benefits

This design provides important advantages:

1. **Separation of concerns**:
   - Evaluators measure objectively
   - Policies define compliance thresholds based on context

2. **Transparency**:
   - Threshold requirements are codified in readable policy files 
   - Developers can see exactly what standards apply in each domain

3. **Versioning and governance**:
   - Thresholds can be versioned alongside policies
   - Changes to compliance standards are tracked in policy files

4. **Extensibility**:
   - New domains can add policies without changing evaluator code
   - Multiple policy sets can be applied to the same evaluation results

The Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py example should integrate with this architecture by:

1. Capturing interactions from the specialist agents
2. Creating a contract with appropriate domain context
3. Evaluating using standard evaluators (no custom thresholds)
4. Applying healthcare-specific policies that contain the appropriate thresholds

This maintains AICertify's vision as a composable evaluation framework where policies, not evaluator configurations, define domain-specific compliance standards.
