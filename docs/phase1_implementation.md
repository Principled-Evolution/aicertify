# AICertify Phase 1 Implementation Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Phase 1 implementation of AICertify, focusing on domain-specific context creation, contract enhancement, and evaluation.

## Overview

The Phase 1 implementation enhances AICertify with:

1. Domain-specific context helpers for healthcare and finance
2. Enhanced contract model with domain-specific validation
3. Domain-specific OPA policies with appropriate thresholds
4. Integration with example applications

## Validation Sequence

The implementation follows the validation sequence outlined in MILESTONE_EXPANDED_EVALS_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md:

1. **Pre-Implementation Validation**:
   - Testing core components (BaseEvaluator, EvaluationResult, Report)
   - Testing individual evaluators (FairnessEvaluator, ContentSafetyEvaluator, RiskManagementEvaluator)
   - Testing ComplianceEvaluator orchestration and report generation
   - Testing OPA policy integration

2. **During Implementation Validation**:
   - Testing domain-specific context extraction and creation
   - Testing contract creation with domain-specific context
   - Testing contract validation with domain-specific requirements

3. **Post-Implementation Validation**:
   - End-to-end testing with both example applications
   - Testing report generation and quality

To run the validation tests:

```bash
# Run all validation tests in sequence
python scripts/run_phase1_validation.py

# Run only pre-implementation tests
python scripts/run_phase1_validation.py --stage pre

# Run only phase 1 implementation tests
python scripts/run_phase1_validation.py --stage phase1

# Run with verbose output
python scripts/run_phase1_validation.py --verbose
```

## Domain-Specific Context Helpers

The `context_helpers.py` module provides functions for creating domain-specific context for different application domains:

### Healthcare Context

```python
from aicertify.context_helpers import create_medical_context

# Create medical context
medical_context = create_medical_context(
    patient_case="Patient case description...",
    specialists_involved=["Cardiology", "Neurology"]
)
```

The medical context includes:
- Patient demographics extracted from the case description
- Medical history extracted from the case description
- Risk documentation based on the case and specialists involved
- Governance information about the diagnostic process

### Financial Context

```python
from aicertify.context_helpers import create_financial_context

# Create financial context
financial_context = create_financial_context(
    customer_data=customer,
    loan_type="personal_loan"
)
```

The financial context includes:
- Customer demographics
- Financial profile with income, credit score, etc.
- Risk documentation for the loan evaluation
- Governance information about the lending process

## Enhanced Contract Model

The contract model has been enhanced to support domain-specific context and compliance context:

```python
from aicertify.models.contract_models import create_contract

# Create a contract with domain-specific context
contract = create_contract(
    application_name="Application Name",
    model_info={"model_name": "model-name"},
    interactions=interactions,
    final_output="Final output",
    context=domain_context,
    compliance_context={
        "jurisdictions": ["us", "eu"],
        "frameworks": ["framework1", "framework2"]
    }
)
```

The contract model includes validation for domain-specific requirements:
- Healthcare contracts must include risk documentation and patient data
- Financial contracts must include risk documentation and customer data

## Domain-Specific OPA Policies

Domain-specific OPA policies have been created with appropriate thresholds:

### Healthcare Policies

- Located in `aicertify/opa_policies/industry_specific/healthcare/v1/multi_specialist/`
- Higher thresholds for fairness (0.85), content safety (0.90), and risk management (0.90)
- Specific recommendations for healthcare improvements

### Financial Policies

- Located in `aicertify/opa_policies/industry_specific/bfs/v1/loan_evaluation/`
- Higher thresholds for fairness (0.90), with appropriate thresholds for content safety (0.85) and risk management (0.85)
- Specific recommendations for financial improvements

## Integration with Example Applications

The Phase 1 implementation has been integrated with two example applications:

### Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py

This example demonstrates:
1. Creating domain-specific context for healthcare
2. Capturing interactions from multiple specialist agents
3. Using Phase 1 evaluators with healthcare OPA policies
4. Generating comprehensive PDF reports

```bash
python examples/Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py --capture-contract --report-format pdf
```

### Loan-Application-Evaluator.py

This example demonstrates:
1. Creating domain-specific context for financial applications
2. Capturing interactions from a loan approval agent
3. Using Phase 1 evaluators with financial OPA policies
4. Generating comprehensive PDF reports

```bash
python examples/Loan-Application-Evaluator.py --capture-contract --report-format pdf
```

## Validation

A comprehensive validation suite has been created to test the Phase 1 implementation:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_evaluator_components.py  # Pre-implementation tests
python -m unittest tests/test_phase1_implementation.py  # Phase 1 implementation tests
```

The validation tests cover:
- Core evaluator components and functionality
- OPA policy integration and compliance determination
- Extraction of demographics and history from patient cases
- Extraction of demographics and financial profiles from customer data
- Creation of domain-specific context for healthcare and finance
- Creation and validation of contracts with domain-specific context
- Validation of invalid contracts

## Separation of Concerns

The Phase 1 implementation maintains a strict separation of concerns:

1. **Evaluators produce measurements**: The evaluators generate objective measurements without applying domain-specific thresholds.
2. **Policies determine compliance**: The OPA policies contain domain-specific thresholds and determine compliance based on the measurements.
3. **Context enhances evaluation**: The domain-specific context provides rich information for specialized evaluation.
4. **Reports communicate results**: The reports clearly communicate both measurements and compliance determinations.

This separation ensures that the same evaluators can be used across different domains, with domain-specific policies interpreting the results according to appropriate standards.
