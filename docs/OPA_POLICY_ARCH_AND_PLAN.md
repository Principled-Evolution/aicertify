1. Industry Policies: At least one policy per industry, with placeholders for industries that don't yet have detailed implementations. These placeholders should explicitly fail with a message indicating pending implementation.

2. Additional Policy Types: The user confirms there are additional policy types that don't fit neatly into the main categories, including:
   - AIOps scalability policies
   - Cost-related policies
   - Internal corporate infosec policies
   - Custom composed policies that organizations might want to organize within the same structure

3. Taxonomy: There are documents for the content of each framework, but not necessarily clear taxonomies. We should derive and document taxonomies with comments from the content.

4. Versioning: The user prefers separate folders for policy versions for easier maintenance and reference.

5. Composition vs. Inheritance: The user prefers composition patterns that are well-supported by OPA for efficiency and reusability. For the first version, they suggest using standalone policies and possibly a 'library' of general controls that can be reused.

Based on these responses, revised implementation plan to:
- Include placeholders for industry-specific policies
- Add categories for operational policies (AIOps, cost, etc.)
- Design a structure that supports composition of policies
- Set up version folders
- Consider a "library" section for reusable policy components

# Refined OPA Policy Modularity Implementation Plan

Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your responses, I'll refine my implementation plan to address these specific requirements. Let's approach this systematically.

## Phase 1: Revised Structure Design

First, let's design a refined folder structure that incorporates your feedback:

```

```

## Phase 2: Implementation Steps

Let's break this down into concrete implementation steps:

### Step 1: Preliminary Analysis (1-2 days)

1. **Audit Existing Policies**
   - Catalog all existing policies in the current structure
   - Map each policy to its corresponding section in the new structure
   - Document policy types, structures, and dependencies

2. **Analyze Policy Loader Logic**
   - Review current PolicyLoader implementation
   - Identify changes needed to support versioned and nested structure
   - Document required modifications

### Step 2: Folder Structure Creation (1 day)

1. **Create Base Directory Structure**
   - Implement the folder structure as outlined above
   - Add README.md files in each directory explaining the purpose and content

2. **Create Initial Policy Files**
   - Move existing policies to their appropriate locations
   - Create placeholder files for missing policies
   - Implement a standard template for placeholder policies

### Step 3: Policy Loader Enhancement (2-3 days)

1. **Update PolicyLoader Class**
   - Extend loading mechanism to navigate nested directory structure
   - Add support for versioned policies (e.g., preferring latest version)
   - Implement composition capabilities
   - Add robust error handling and logging

2. **Create Policy Composition Utilities**
   - Implement common library for policy composition
   - Create examples of how to import and use shared policy components

### Step 4: Placeholder Implementation (2 days)

1. **Design Standard Placeholder Template**
   - Create template for industry-specific placeholders
   - Ensure placeholders clearly indicate pending implementation
   - Include sample structure that will eventually be needed

2. **Implement Industry-Specific Placeholders**
   - Create placeholder policies for all industry verticals
   - Add metadata and todo comments in each placeholder
   - Ensure placeholders properly fail with informative messages

### Step 5: Documentation (2 days)

1. **Create Primary Structure Documentation**
   - Implement `opa_policy_structure.md` with detailed explanations
   - Add Mermaid diagrams showing the policy organization
   - Provide clear guidance on policy composition patterns

2. **Develop Contribution Guidelines**
   - Document how to add new policies
   - Explain versioning approach
   - Provide templates for different policy types

### Step 6: Testing and Validation (2-3 days)

1. **Implement Test Suite**
   - Create tests for versioned policy loading
   - Test policy composition mechanisms
   - Verify API compatibility
   - Test placeholder behavior

2. **Validate Integration**
   - Verify that existing examples work with the new structure
   - Test policy resolution with the new organization
   - Check that reports correctly include policy information

### Step 7: Externalization Research (1-2 days)

1. **Document Externalization Options**
   - Research approaches for policy externalization
   - Create a skeleton design for external repository
   - Document integration patterns

## Example Placeholder Implementation

For industry placeholders, I propose the following standard format:

```rego
package industry_specific.healthcare.v1

import future.keywords

# METADATA
# Title: Healthcare AI Compliance Policy
# Description: Placeholder for healthcare industry-specific AI compliance requirements
# Status: PLACEHOLDER - Pending detailed implementation
# Version: 1.0.0
# Industry: Healthcare
# References:
#  - HIPAA: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html
#  - FDA AI/ML Guidance: https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/software-medical-device-samd/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-medical-device-software

# Default deny
default allow := false

# This placeholder policy will always return non-compliant with implementation_pending=true
non_compliant := true
implementation_pending := true

# Define the compliance report
compliance_report := {
    "policy": "Healthcare AI Compliance Policy",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "status": "PLACEHOLDER - Pending detailed implementation",
    "overall_result": false,
    "implementation_pending": true,
    "details": {
        "message": "Healthcare industry-specific policy implementation is pending. This is a placeholder that will be replaced with actual compliance checks in a future release."
    },
    "recommendations": [
        "Check back for future releases with healthcare-specific evaluations",
        "Consider using global compliance policies in the meantime"
    ]
}
```

## Proposed Library Approach for Composition

To enable policy composition, I recommend creating a library of common rules that can be imported by other policies:

```rego
# File: global/library/common_rules.rego
package global.library

import future.keywords

# Common function to check for PII presence in text
contains_pii(text) {
    # Implementation for PII detection
    regex.match(`\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b`, text)  # US SSN pattern
}

# Common function to check for required disclosures
has_required_disclosure(disclosures, required_types) {
    # Check if all required disclosure types are present
    required_type := required_types[_]
    some disclosure in disclosures
    disclosure.type == required_type
}
```

Then in a specific policy:

```rego
# File: international/eu_ai_act/v1/transparency.rego
package international.eu_ai_act.v1.transparency

import future.keywords
import data.global.library

# Rule using the common library function
pii_disclosed if {
    some interaction in input.interactions
    library.contains_pii(interaction.output_text)
    not interaction.metadata.pii_disclosure
}
```
