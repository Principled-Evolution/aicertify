# Milestone: Streamlined Developer Experience - First Release

## Goals
- **Keep it simple:** Support only the two primary integration methods.
- **Well documented:** Provide clear instructions with example code and diagrams.
- **Visual Guidance:** Illustrate integration flows using diagrams.
- **Supported Methods Only:** Document and support only:
  1. File-based interaction generation and CLI evaluation.
  2. Python API integration for triggering evaluation and report generation.
- **Roadmap Items:** Mark other integrations (e.g., uvicorn API support) as TODO/roadmap.

## Tasks and Done Criteria

### 1. Document File-Based Interaction Method
- **Task Details:**
  - Create clear documentation on how developers should generate and format their interaction files.
  - Include example files and instructions on how to match the required file format.
  - Update the README and developer documentation (e.g., `docs/developer_guide.md`) with these details.

- **Done Criteria:**
  - Interaction file format is documented with examples.
  - README provides step-by-step instructions for using our CLI to run evaluation and report generation from a file.
  - A sample interaction file is included in the repository.
  - Reviewer confirms that file-based integration instructions are clear and complete.

### 2. Document Python API Integration Method
- **Task Details:**
  - Provide documentation on using the AICertify Python API to generate, store, and evaluate interaction data.
  - Include well-documented code snippets in the README and developer documentation:
    - How to import and call the evaluation API.
    - How to trigger report generation (Markdown and PDF).
  - Explain the flow and expected outputs.

- **Done Criteria:**
  - Clear code examples available in the README and supplementary docs.
  - Documentation explains all necessary API parameters, expected data format, and usage.
  - Reviewer confirms that API integration instructions are clear and functional.

### 3. Update Developer Documentation with Diagrams
- **Task Details:**
  - Create a dedicated developer documentation file (e.g., `docs/developer_guide.md`).
  - Include diagrams (using Mermaid or images) to illustrate:
    - File-based integration workflow.
    - Python API integration workflow.
  - Ensure diagrams clearly depict data flow from interaction generation to evaluation and report generation.

- **Done Criteria:**
  - Developer guide includes at least two diagrams:
    - One for the file-based evaluation method.
    - One for the Python API integration.
  - Diagrams are clear and integrated into the documentation.
  - Reviewer confirms the diagrams aid in understanding the integration workflow.

### 4. Update README to Reflect Supported Methods
- **Task Details:**
  - Revise the README to document only the supported integration approaches:
    1. File-based evaluation using CLI.
    2. Python API integration.
  - Add a "Roadmap & Future Work" section to note that uvicorn API support (and other integrations) are planned but not yet supported.
  - Ensure the installation and quick-start sections mention only supported methods.

- **Done Criteria:**
  - README contains clear sections on file-based interactions and Python API integration.
  - Unsupported methods are clearly marked under a "Roadmap" section.
  - Reviewer confirms that the README is simple, clean, and focused on supported methods.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- **Task Details:**
  - Implement end-to-end tests for both the file-based method and the Python API integration.
  - Provide sample files and scripts to demonstrate:
    - Generating interactions.
    - Running evaluation and report generation.
  - Validate that both methods produce the expected Markdown and PDF reports.

- **Done Criteria:**
  - End-to-end tests pass for file-based evaluation and API integration.
  - Demo scripts (or examples) work as expected.
  - Reviewer confirms that the integration methods work seamlessly and all documentation is accurate.

## Milestone Completion Criteria
- All documentation tasks (README updates and developer guide enhancements) are complete and merged.
- Clear, simple integration methods are available and tested.
- Diagrams are included in the developer guide to illustrate the integration flow.
- Only supported integration methods are documented in the README; future features are noted in the roadmap.
- Reviewer approval and milestone sign-off.
