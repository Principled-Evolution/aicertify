# Example Outputs Directory

This directory contains all outputs generated by the example scripts in the AICertify repository. The directory structure is organized as follows:

## Directory Structure

- `outputs/` - Main outputs directory (this directory)
  - `loan_evaluation/` - Outputs from [Loan-Application-Evaluator.py](../Loan-Application-Evaluator.py)
  - `medical_diagnosis/` - Outputs from [Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py](../Medical-Diagnosis-MultiSpecialist-Agents.py)
  - `api_example/` - Outputs from [Medical-Diagnosis-Using-API.py](../Medical-Diagnosis-Using-API.py)
  - `temp_reports/` - Temporary storage for generated reports (shared across examples)

## What's Stored Here

Each example script's output directory contains:

1. Contract JSON files - Captured AI interactions in the AICertify contract format
2. Generated reports - Evaluation reports in markdown and/or PDF format
3. Evaluation results - Output from the AICertify evaluation process

## Usage

The example scripts are configured to automatically use these directories when run from any location. You don't need to create these directories manually - they will be created automatically when the scripts are run.

If you want to specify a custom output directory, you can use the `--contract-storage` parameter:

```bash
python examples/Loan-Application-Evaluator.py --capture-contract --report-format pdf --contract-storage my_custom_path
```

This structure ensures that all outputs are contained within the examples directory for easy access and reference.
