"""
This is a quickstart example of the aicertify library.
It will create applications, select target regulations and evaluate them.

Steps:
1. Create a regulations set
2. Select target regulations
3. Create your application(s)
4. Evaluate the application(s) against the regulation(s)
5. Get the report
