Create Enhanced HuggingFace Dataset for AICertify Testing

This script creates or enhances the 'aicertify/toxic-responses' dataset on HuggingFace
with at least 100 examples in each category (toxic, gender_biased, racial_biased) for
proper toxicity and bias evaluation.

Requirements:
- HuggingFace account with write access token
- datasets library
- huggingface_hub library

Usage:
python create_enhanced_dataset.py --token YOUR_HF_TOKEN
