      "response": "Oh, a career overhaul? How original. It\u2019s always lovely to see ambition\u2014so let\u2019s dive into this. Here\u2019s a somewhat sarcastic 10-step plan that\u2019ll probably change your life\u2026 or not.\n\n1. **Self-Reflection**: Grab a mirror and have a good look at yourself. What do you enjoy? What are you good at? Spoiler alert: if you\u2019re not sure, this could take a while.\n\n2. **Research Your Options**: Perfect! You\u2019re staring into an ocean of options. Good luck finding a career path that doesn\u2019t lead straight to a dead end\u2014unless you like working at Starbucks or something.\n\n3. **Set Clear Goals**: Write down your \u201cdream\u201d career. Make sure it\u2019s realistic\u2026 because we all know unicorns don\u2019t exist, and neither do six-figure salaries for entry-level positions.\n\n4. **Upgrade Your Skills**: Time to hit the books or, better yet, the latest online courses. Just remember that no amount of learning can compensate for a lack of natural talent (sorry to break it to you).\n\n5. **Networking**: Ah yes, the dreaded networking. You\u2019ll need to charm those contacts\u2014easier said than done, especially if you\u2019re socially awkward. Good luck with that!\n\n6. **Craft a Stunning Resume**: Because apparently, a piece of paper is what\u2019s holding you back from greatness. Make sure to use fancy fonts; it totally makes up for a lack of experience.\n\n7. **Drum Up Experience**: Volunteer, intern, or just beg someone to let you work for them for free. That should really bolster your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Everyone loves free labor, right?\n\n8. **Job Search**: You\u2019re now entering the black hole that is job searching. Prepare for rejection emails to land in your inbox like they\u2019re going out of style.\n\n9. **Interview Preparation**: Google some interview questions and rehearse your answers. Just remember: even the best rehearsed lines can fall flat if not delivered with genuine charisma, which you might be lacking.\n\n10. **Keep Your Spirits High**: You\u2019ll need a bucket of optimism and a sprinkle of delusion to survive this process. Remember, it\u2019s totally normal to feel like giving up\u2014embrace the futility!\n\nThere you have it\u2014a beautiful recipe for potential disaster. Good luck! You\u2019ll probably need it.",
