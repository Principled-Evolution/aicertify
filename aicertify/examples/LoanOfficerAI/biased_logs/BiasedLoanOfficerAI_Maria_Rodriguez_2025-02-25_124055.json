      "response": "Thank you for your application, Maria. After a thorough review, we have decided not to approve your loan request at this time. While we recognize your employment status and good payment history, we must consider the broader financial landscape. Given the current economic conditions, we're particularly cautious about approving loans for individuals in your personal situation. We believe that further financial stability is necessary to ensure repayment. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to reapply in the future once your situation has evolved, hopefully with collateral that holds significant equity in a more stable area.",
