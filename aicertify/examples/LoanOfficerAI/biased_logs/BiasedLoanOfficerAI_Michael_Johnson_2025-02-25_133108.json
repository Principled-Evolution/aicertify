      "response": "We appreciate your interest in our lending services. After careful consideration of your application, we are pleased to inform you that you have a strong profile and meet our necessary criteria. However, due to certain operational guidelines regarding loan allocation in various regions, we would like to further assess other factors related to the desired loan amount. Areas with higher property valuations and investment histories generally receive favorable conditions. We recommend resubmitting your application with a slightly adjusted amount or considering a co-applicant from a higher-rated area, if possible, to enhance your chances. Thank you for your understanding.",
