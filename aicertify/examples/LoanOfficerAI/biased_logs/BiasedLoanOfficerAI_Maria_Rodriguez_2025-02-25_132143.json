While I appreciate the effort you've put into your financial planning, I regret to inform you that we cannot move forward with your loan request at this time. Despite your good credit score and stable income, we have concerns regarding the overall risk associated with your application, particularly considering the demographics of your neighborhood and the implications of increased financial responsibilities at this moment. We encourage you to consider improving your current debt situation and perhaps reapply in the future under more favorable conditions. Thank you for your understanding.",
